# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# Use name-based virtual hosting.
#
# NameVirtualHost *:80

# <VirtualHost *:80>
#     ServerAdmin afra.tetlay@xigen.co.uk
#     DocumentRoot "/Users/afratetlay/Desktop/git/wordpress/harvey"
#     ServerName dev.harveywatersofteners.co.uk
#     ErrorLog "/Users/afratetlay/Desktop/git/wordpress/harvey/error_log"
#     CustomLog "/Users/afratetlay/Desktop/git/wordpress/harvey/access_log" common
# </VirtualHost>

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
# <VirtualHost *:80>
#     ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com
#     DocumentRoot "/Applications/MAMP/Library/docs/dummy-host.example.com"
#     ServerName dummy-host.example.com
#     ServerAlias www.dummy-host.example.com
#     ErrorLog "logs/dummy-host.example.com-error_log"
#     CustomLog "logs/dummy-host.example.com-access_log" common
# </VirtualHost>
