## UX

### Project Goals

I recreated the <a href="https://stores.sainsburys.co.uk/list/place/@53.47949,-2.2451148/1/all">Sainsbury's store locator.</a> I wanted to expand my knowledge and create a project where I can integrate PHP, Google API, MySQL through MAMP. 

## Setting up

1. **MAMP**
- I downloaded and set <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/">MAMP</a> locally. 


2. **Data**
I added all the data on MySQL that I will be using on the project such as the address of the stores, opening and closing times, Store name and the coordinates. 


3. **Installed tailwindcss**
I integrated <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwindcss</a> into my project. 


4. **Started Coding the FrontEnd**
    - I have added a feature whenever the user click on a card, there is a counter which counts it. 


5. **Win modals** 
    - When the user has completed the game a modal will appear, with the time it took them to complete and an option to play again.
